# DQ R-Project 14: Predicting Condominium Sale Prices
This is my fourteenth project in Dataquest towards my journey in R Programming. This project aims to determine how well the size of a condominum predicts sale price across New York City as a whole and per borough. Specifically, we'll be exploring property sales data for all five boroughs in new york and build models to understand the relationship beteen condominium size and sales price. In this project, the following concepts are used to achieve the given problem:
- Bivariate Relationships
- Fitting Linear Models
- Assessing Model Accuracy
